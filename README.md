# teaching

contains random scripts used while teaching various classes.

quadric_surface.py = plots the six quadric surfaces, as well as demonstrating surfaces and tangent planes.

linear_regression_poly1.py = given the data {(x_i,y_i)}_{i=1}^n, finds the least squares regression line using the 
analytic solution (i.e. minimizing the squared error summataion), as well as demonstrating how to do this using scipy.stats or scikit-learn.

linear_regression_poly2.py = given the data {(x_i,y_i)}_{i=1}^n, finds the least squares regression parabola by solving the 3x3 system resulting from minimizing the squared error summation, as well as demonstrating how to do this using scikit-leran.
